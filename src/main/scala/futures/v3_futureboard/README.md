Future Board
============

This package (*v3_futureboard*) contains the source code for 
a little Swing GUI application I named “Futureboard.” It works 
a little like a  text-only version of Flipboard or an RSS reader.

Run the `FutureBoard` object to see how the application works.
When you run the application, click the File menu, and then
click the Update menu item, you should see a result that looks
like the *future-board-example.jpg* image in this directory.

>This application will look like that as long as a) those
URLs remain valid, and b) the CSS on those pages matches the
CSS this application expects to find.
